An **Operating System (OS)** is [[#System Software]] that manages computer hardware, software resources, and provides common services for computer programs. It acts as an intermediary between users and the computer hardware. Key functions of an OS include:

- **Process Management:** Handles the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes.
- **Memory Management:** Manages the allocation and deallocation of memory space.
- **File System Management:** Organizes, stores, retrieves, and manages data on storage devices.
- **Device Management:** Controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices like printers, disk drives, etc.
- **User Interface:** Provides a user interface, such as a command-line or graphical user interface (GUI).

# System Software
System software is a type of computer software designed to provide a platform for other software and manage the hardware components of a computer system. It acts as an intermediary between user applications and the computer hardware. Examples of system software include:

- Operating Systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Device drivers
- Utility programs (e.g., disk management tools, antivirus software)
- Firmware

System software is essential for the proper functioning of a computer, as it ensures hardware and software can communicate and work together efficiently. It usually runs in the background and is required for running application software.

#### Question : If you try to use only software applications without an operating system (OS), the computer will not work as intended. Here’s why:

1. **No Hardware Management:** The OS manages hardware resources (CPU, memory, storage, input/output devices). Without an OS, there would be no way for applications to communicate with hardware directly in a safe or standardized way.
    
2. **No Platform for Apps:** Application software is designed to run on top of an OS. The OS provides essential services and APIs that applications depend on (file access, networking, security, etc.). Without an OS, applications would have to manage all these complex tasks themselves.
    
3. **No Multitasking:** The OS allows multiple applications to run at the same time, switching between them efficiently. Without it, running more than one program at a time would be extremely difficult.
    
4. **No User Interface:** The OS provides interfaces (like desktop, menus, command line) for users to interact with applications and the computer.

**In short:**  
Without an operating system, application software cannot function on a modern computer. The computer would not boot up to a usable state, and users would not be able to run or interact with any programs. The OS is essential for bridging the gap between hardware and application software.


#### The main functions of an Operating System (OS) are:

1. **Process Management:**  
    Manages the creation, scheduling, and termination of processes. Ensures smooth execution of multiple programs by handling process switching and synchronization.
    
2. **Memory Management:**  
    Allocates and deallocates memory space as needed by programs. Keeps track of each byte in a computer’s memory and manages sharing among processes.
    
3. **File System Management:**  
    Organizes and controls the reading, writing, creation, and deletion of files on storage devices. Maintains the file directory and access permissions.
    
4. **Device Management:**  
    Controls and coordinates the use of hardware devices (e.g., printers, disk drives). Provides device drivers as an interface between hardware and software.
    
5. **Security and Access Control:**  
    Protects data and resources from unauthorized access. Implements user authentication, permissions, and data encryption.
    
6. **User Interface:**  
    Provides interfaces (command-line or graphical) for user interaction with the system and applications.
    
7. **Resource Allocation:**  
    Allocates CPU time, memory, and I/O resources to different programs and users efficiently.
    
8. **Error Detection and Handling:**  
    Detects and handles errors in hardware and software, ensuring reliable operation and recovery from failures.
    

These functions allow the OS to act as an intermediary between users, applications, and hardware, ensuring efficient and secure operation of the computer system.
