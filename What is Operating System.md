# System Software
System software is a type of computer software designed to provide a platform for other software and manage the hardware components of a computer system. It acts as an intermediary between user applications and the computer hardware. Examples of system software include:

- Operating Systems (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS)
- Device drivers
- Utility programs (e.g., disk management tools, antivirus software)
- Firmware

System software is essential for the proper functioning of a computer, as it ensures hardware and software can communicate and work together efficiently. It usually runs in the background and is required for running application software.
